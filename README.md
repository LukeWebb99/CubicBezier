A program made using SFML, C++ to demonstrate a Cubic Bezier Curve with moveable anchors

<h1>How to Use</h1>

the program has two types of anchors shown as red and white points in the window for manipulating the line:
- White moves the position of the line
- Red changes the curve of the line

both types can be clicked and dragged on and moved freely around the window.


<h2><b>Dependencies</b></h2>

For managing dependencies I used <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg" target="_blank"> vcpkg </a> this allows the repo to be a smaller size for download
> vcpkg install sfml
